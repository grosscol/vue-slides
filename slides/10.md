# It's Javascript
There's some good, bad, and ugly.

## The Good

- Runs on the client
- Is easy to write
- Has many libraries
- Asynchronous by default

## The Bad

- Libraries change frequently
- Meager standard library
- Asynchronous by default

## The Ugly

Javascript will ~~helpfully~~ _malicously_ cast until it gets _something_ that runs.

```js
> 12 == "12"
true
```

```js
> 1 + 10
11
> 1 + "10"
'110'
```
## The Ugly

```js
> typeof(NaN)
'number'

> NaN === NaN
false
```

## The Ugly

```js
> null > 0
false

> null == false
false

> null === false
false

> null >= false 
true
``` 

## The Ugly

```js
> {} + []   // 0
0

> [] + {}   // '[object Object]'
'[object Object]'
```
